      <p>
        Michio Kaku is a renowned theoretical physicist, futurist, and educator,
        known for his work in string theory. He is a professor of theoretical
        physics at the City College of New York and a prolific author, having
        written numerous best-selling books on physics and the future of
        technology.

        Dr. Kaku inspired me as a kid. I would get stuck to the TV watching him
        speak with passion and excitement of what the future may bring. He has a
        way of explaining advanced concepts in such fun ways. Growing up as a
        kid in the suburbs of NYC, I always wanted to attend one of his classes
        at CCNY.
