# Deliverables 
## Melvin Gonzalez, Jr. | 2024-RTT-35

## Description
My website is a Personal Library website. It's a site for me to share with viewers, my love for reading with details about books I've read and their authors. It is split amongst three pages:
    
    1. home.html: the main page. It gives a reason for my page, how viewers can interact with the page, and also a chance for viewers to help me select my next read.

    2. authors.html: page listing some of the authors whose books I've read, as well as basic info about them, with links to their websites. For Michio Kaku, his name is a link, that leads to my final page.

    3. michio.html: page giving a short bio of Michio Kaku. It also shows short summaries of the two books of his that I've read, links to the respective Amazon pages that appear upon hovering over the book photo, and a survey to see what my viewers think about Dr. Kaku.

## Reflection

a. I definitely could have planned out my pages more. It was a struggle between trying to plan everything out, but also not sure how I would incorporate every technical aspect I would be graded on. I think I would take a full day of organizing/planning next time, so I'm not trying to plan everything out at the same time I'm coding.

b. The hardest part of the project wasn't specifically technical requirements, but asthetics. I wanted my paragraphs and photos/GIF's to have a certain layout, but that was easier said than done. I had to keep looking over resources about how to position elements within a container. This is definitely something I need to practice more to gain confidence.

c. I would love to add JavaScript if I had the appropriate knowledge and time. I know JavaScript can add more functionality and make my page more dynamic. I particularly would want to use the dropdown menu in the Main page as a way to then go to the Authors page. I am glad I found a way that made sense to go from Authors to Michio Kaku. But the whole point of good website design is for movement between pages to feel seemless and intuitive, so a way to go from Main to other pages is needed.

d. Firstly, take a day to plan out layout and needed elements and how to incorporate measures. Also, keep studying the box model, especially in reference to containers and elements within.
